1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// your code goes here
for(i= 0; amount <= bank_balance; i++) {
    amount += PHONE_PRICE;
if (amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD){
    amount += ACCESSORY_PRICE;
}
}

function calculateTax(amount) {
    return (amount * TAX_RATE);
}

var finalAmount;

finalAmount = amount + calculateTax(amount);

function formatAmount(amount) {
    return ( amount.toFixed(2) );
}

finalAmount = formatAmount(finalAmount);
console.log(`$${finalAmount}`);

```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js
// your code goes here
for (let n= 0; n < 21; n++) {
    if(n % 2 == 0){
        alert(`${n} is even`)
    } else {
        alert(`${n} is odd`)
    }
} 


```

3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
```js

for (let n = 0; n < 11; n++) {
    console.log(`${n} * 9 = ${n * 9}`);
}

```

4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)
```js

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    for (let j = 1; j <= 10; j++){
        console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${i * j}`)
    }
}

```

5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

// Your code goes heres
let str = "";
for (let i = 1; i<10; i++) {
    if(i = 5){
        str = str + i + "\n";
    } else{
        str = str + i + ",";
    }
}
str = str + i;
console.log(str);

```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
// Your code goes here
let i = 1;
let addition = 0;
while (i<= 20){
    addition += i;    
    i++;
}
console.log(addition);
```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// Your code goes here

let i = 1;
while(i < 21){
    if(i % 2 == 0){
        console.log(i);
    }
    i++;
}

```
